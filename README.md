# Titanic_Kaggle_Group
A project that predicts the likelyhood of Titanic survivors using the Python language

Running this program requires 3 packages:
  1) Numpy
  2) Pandas
  3) Sklearn

I suggest that you download Anaconda. Simply open the terminal and write "conda install scikit-learn". Anaconda contains all of the packages that are necessary to run this program.  If you do not wish to do so, follow these instructions.

1) Numpy - Numpy is considered the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.  Go to https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy and download the appropriate file type.  For more information on numpy, visit http://www.numpy.org/.
2) Pandas - Pandas makes manipulating and extracting data from excel spreadsheets very easy.  Go to http://pandas.pydata.org/getpandas.html and download the appropriate file type.  For more information on pandas, visit http://pandas.pydata.org/index.html.
3) Sklearn - Sklearn provides the logistic regression that we use as the base of our model.  Use the command "pip install -U scikit-learn" if you have the latest version of pip.  Visit http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ to learn more.
